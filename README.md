Plotting Weather Patterns



The purpose is to create a graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014. The area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day should be shaded. Addionally, the overlay a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.
Finally, the last step is to make the visual nice! Leverage principles from the first  module in this course when developing your solution. Consider issues such as legends, labels, and chart junk.
